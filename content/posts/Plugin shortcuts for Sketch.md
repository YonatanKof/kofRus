There's a thing you're doing all day long - moving your hands and cursor to control your apps - When you add up all these small movements you'll quickly end up whit a big wasteful repetition. You might have missed it because it's small. You might haven't deal with it because you don't know how - Whatever the reason you've let it slide, it's a wast of your time and **this post is for you!** 

# The painful movement of the hand
Seeing top notch developers working without lifting their hands form the keyboard made me think _is there a way for me to work that way?_ So elegant, so efficient, keeping your hands from a wrist infection. At around 2015 the answer was a **soft no** - I've customized every possible shortcut in _Illustrator_. The nicest thing about Illustrator shortcuts was the ease of creating and managing shortcuts with the `Keyboard Shortcuts` panel _(Fig.Ill)_. but some basic functionalities like resizing a shape wasn't available to begin with, so no shortcut could be assigned.
