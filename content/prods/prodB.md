## My 2nd prod

The hero seemed more tormented every passing day. I remember he awoke many times -- screaming in the night -- always something about 'the East'.

One day, he simply left. And shortly thereafter Tristram was attacked by legions of foul demons. Many were slain, and the demons left me to die in that cursed cage.

I believe now that Tristram's hero was that Dark Wanderer who passed this way before the Monastery fell.

I fear even worse, my friend... I fear that Diablo has taken possession of the hero who sought to slay him. If true, Diablo will become more powerful than ever before.

You must stop him or all will be lost.
